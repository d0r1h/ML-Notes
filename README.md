# Machine Learning University

### **Why This !**&#x20;

The Internet is a big place and information is scattered, so if you want to learn something and that's also for free, it is hard to navigate and to keep yourself motivated throughout the journey...\
So to keep yourself and myself too motivated and focused on the goal I have created this [**`ML-university`**](https://59r.gitbook.io/ml-university/)**.** Mostly free, so that you don't need to hunt for the resource in the Black-hole and waste your precious time.

All the resources are taken from the public internet and if you find any copyrighted material and you are the authorized owner of that you can [**Contact me**](mailto:59r@protonmail.com) and the material will be taken down immediately.

{% hint style="info" %}
**This is continuously updated** and if you are a Machine learning practitioner and have some good suggestions to improve this or have some good resources to share, you create a pull request or issue and [contribute](https://github.com/d0r1h/ML-University).
{% endhint %}
