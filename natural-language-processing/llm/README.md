# LLM

AI Language Model (LLM) Agents are advanced machine learning models that have been trained on a diverse range of internet text. They can generate human-like text based on the input they receive. However, they do not understand the text they generate and do not have beliefs, opinions, or consciousness. These agents are designed to assist users in generating text for a variety of purposes, such as drafting emails, writing code, creating written content, tutoring in a variety of subjects, translating languages, simulating characters for video games, and much more.
