# LLM Pre and Post Training





#### Post Training&#x20;

Post-training (sometimes referred to as “alignment”) is a key component of modern LLMs, and the way to “teach” models how to answer in a way that humans like, and how to reason.

Why is post-training different from pre training, you ask? Post-training primes the model to have a conversation with a user, which follows a set of basic rules such as:

1. In a conversation, there’s more than one speaker, and they all take turns talking
2. You should listen before you talk to say something relevant
