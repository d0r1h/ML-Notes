# Machine Learning Engineer



* Great proficiency in Python, any additional knowledge of programming languages is a plus (e.g., Scala, Java, Rust), relational and distributed data storages (e.g., Oracle, mySQL, HDFS) and suitable query language(s) (e.g., SQL).
* Great proficiency in DevOps/MLOps including relevant methods and tool
* Hands-on experience with model optimization (i.e. quantization, pruning) and model deployment frameworks such as TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, and OpenVINO.
* Proficiency with CUDA programming and optimizing code for GPU acceleration.
* Strong background in MLOps practices, including CI/CD using GitHub Actions and containerization with Docker.
* Familiar with at least one LLM inference frameworks (e.g., TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang, TGI(Text Generation Inference)).
* Background knowledge and experience in at least one of the following: GPU programming (CUDA/Triton/TensorRT), compiler, model quantization, and GPU cluster scheduling.
* Deep understanding of KV cache systems like Mooncake, PagedAttention, or custom in-house variants.
* Proficient in Python and C++/CUDA for high-performance deep learning inference.
* Deep understanding of Transformer architectures and LLM/VLM/Diffusion model optimization.
* Knowledge of inference optimization, such as workload scheduling, CUDA graph, compiled, efficient kernels
* Designing a data processing feature end-to-end.
* Designing a predictive model end-to-end, including data collection and preparation, model training and evaluation, and what systems would be needed to run the model in production
