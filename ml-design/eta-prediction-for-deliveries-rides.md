# ETA Prediction for Deliveries/Rides

Building an end-to-end machine learning project for ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) prediction for deliveries or rides is a highly practical case that involves a mix of time-series forecasting, regression modeling, and real-time inference. Here’s a step-by-step roadmap tailored to such a project.

The ETA prediction system forecasts the time required for a delivery or ride to reach its destination, accounting for real-time factors like traffic, weather, and route characteristics.&#x20;

Companies like Uber and Doordash use advanced hybrid models that pair physical routing calculations with post-processing ML models for highest accuracy.​\
