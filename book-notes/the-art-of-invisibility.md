# THE ART OF INVISIBILITY



* **What You’ll Learn**&#x20;
  * Protect your data with good password management
  * Hide your true IP address from places you visit
  * Obscure your computer from being tracked
  * Defend your anonymity
  * Encrypt and send secure Email



“Rule number 1 about being invisible: you can’t ever link your anonymous

online persona with your real-world persona. You just can’t.”

NOTES :

<br>

1. When Download any app for text messaging from app store , look for OTR(off-the record) messaging is higher-stand E2E protocol&#x20;
2. Private browsing doesn’t create temporary files, and therefore it keeps your browsing history off your laptop or mobile device.
3. “emulate geolocation coordinates” While in Chrome, press Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows or Cmd+Option+I on Mac to open the Chrome Developer Tools. The Console window will open, and you can click the three vertical dots at the top right of the Console, then select more tools>sensors. A sensor tab will open. This allows you to define the exact latitude and longitude you want to share.
4. To stay invisible, the MAC address should be changed each time you connect to the wireless network so your Internet sessions cannot easily be correlated to you.
5. Certainly the metadata inside your image files can be used to locate you. &#x20;

EXIF data in a digital image contains : the date and time when the picture was snapped, the make and model number of the camera, longitude and latitude of the place&#x20;

<br>

6. Accelerometer device\[chip] responsible for determining the orientation of your device, whether you are holding it in landscape or portrait view.&#x20;
7. Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology used by Law enforcement to recognize the vehicles.
8. An attacker can use Google filters to search for “D-Link Internet cameras.” The attacker can then look for the models that default to no authentication, then go to a website such as Shodan, click a link, and view the video streams at his leisure.
9. Conferencing System \[in office ] use a unique protocol H.323
10. MacBook Pro, a Dell XPS M1210 laptop, an Asus 900 laptop \[ laptop used by Kevin Mitnick ]&#x20;
11. &#x20;Securing Data While You Travel Abroad or Vice Versa&#x20;

&#x20;    &#x20;

&#x20;      1\. CleanUp any sensitive Data and perform Full Backup .

&#x20;                     2\. Encrypt data with a strong Key and don’t keep passphrase with you .

&#x20;                     3\. Upload the encrypted Data to Cloud and download when needed.

&#x20;                     4\.&#x20;

<br>

12. &#x20;Wiping data is not the same as deleting data. Deleting data only changes the MBR entry for a file (the index used to find parts of the file on the hard drive); the file (or some of its parts) remains on the hard drive until new data is written over that part of the hard drive.&#x20;
13. Wiping Data, securely overwrites the data  in the file with random data and this can be done using any File-shredding software.
