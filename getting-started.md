# Getting Started

At the high-level machine learning algorithms can be categorized into 2 different categories based on their learning style. <br>

1. **Supervised Learning**

Input data is called training data and has a known label or result such as spam/not-spam(classifier) or a stock price(numerical value). A model is prepared through a training process in which it is required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions are wrong. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.&#x20;

Example problems are classification and regression. Example algorithms include Logistic Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network.



2. **Unsupervised Learning**

Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result. A model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. It may be through a mathematical process to systematically reduce redundancy, or it may be to organize data by similarity.&#x20;

Example problems are clustering, conditionality reduction, and association rule learning. Example algorithms include the Apriori algorithm and K-Means.
