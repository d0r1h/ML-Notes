# Natural language processing

**Natural language processing(NLP)** is an area of research in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with processing natural languages such as English or Mandarin. This processing generally involves translating natural language into data (numbers) that a computer can use to learn about the world. And this understanding of the world is sometimes used to generate natural language text that reflects that understanding.

A natural language processing system is often referred to as a **pipeline** because it usually involves several stages of processing where natural language flows in one end and the processed output flows out the other.

So before going to techniques of NLP, we shall take a look at different application and task that we can perform using NLP.
